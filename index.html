        <p>
          The Kathakar Podcast, proudly brought to you by Kathakar Media, seeks to analyze and dissect important turning points in history along with other complex historical events and developments with an interdisciplinary approach.

        </p>
        <p>
          In our episodes, we try to emphasize the importance of research techniques and methods of analysis in the field of history, as several of our conversations include developing an understanding of the role of quantitative methods in elucidating sequences of events and causal effects of events. With these discussions, we hope to give our audience a picture of how past events have shaped today’s societies and how they affected the common individual.

          Our episodes are currently available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Anchor, RadioPublic, Pocket Casts, Breaker, and several other services.
